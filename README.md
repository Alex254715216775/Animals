The provided code is a Java Swing application that demonstrates the use of radio buttons to display images corresponding to different pets. The main components and functionalities of the application are described as follows:

Class Definition:

The RadioButtonDemo class extends JFrame and sets up the GUI for the application.
Constructor (RadioButtonDemo()):

Initializes the frame, sets the title, default close operation, size, location, and resizability.
Calls the createView() method to set up the GUI components.
createView() Method:

Creates and configures the main panel with a GridLayout to hold the radio buttons and the image label.
Creates a sub-panel (radioPanel) with a vertical box layout to arrange the radio buttons.
Creates five radio buttons (birdButton, catButton, dogButton, rabbitButton, pigButton) and groups them using a ButtonGroup to ensure only one button is selected at a time.
Adds the radio buttons to the radioPanel and assigns action listeners to each button using an inner class PetButtonListener.
Adds the radioPanel and an initially empty petImageLabel to the main panel.
Sets the default selected radio button to "Pig" and displays the corresponding image using the displayImage("Pig.jpeg") method.
displayImage(String imageName) Method:

Loads and displays an image from the resources folder (images/) based on the given image name.
Uses getClass().getClassLoader().getResource() to locate the image file and sets it as an icon on petImageLabel.
Inner Class (PetButtonListener):

Implements ActionListener to handle radio button selection events.
Changes the displayed image based on the selected radio button by calling displayImage() with the appropriate image name.
main Method:

Uses SwingUtilities.invokeLater() to ensure the GUI creation and updates happen on the Event Dispatch Thread, and makes the RadioButtonDemo frame visible.
